## About Me

Hello, everyone! My name is Angela, and I have had a fascinating journey from being a music teacher to pursuing a career in computer science.

With an undergraduate degree in Music Education from the University of Illinois, Masters of Education Leadership from Indiana University, a certificate in Data Science and Business Analytics from the University of Texas at Austin, and a graduate certificate from iCAN who is planning on starting my Masters in Computer Science at the University of Illinois in the fall, it is fair to say I am a perpetual student who is fascinated with learning, passionate about collaborating, and excited about my future in computer science. 

I am honored to be a participant in the 2023 DREAM cohort. The Distributed REsearch Apprenticeships for Master's, DREAM for short, is designed to provide research opportunities for people entering the computer science field after their undergraduate degree to support those entering the field with mentorship, professional development, and collaboration in pursuit of higher education.

## About My Advisor

My advisor is Dr. Yael Gertner from the University of Illinois.

She earned her BS and MS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT, and she earned her PhD from the University of Pennslyania in Computer and Information Science. She research and contributions include the power of cryptography, specifically with primitives and Private Information Retrieval as well as language acquisition with regards to learning verbs and sentence comprehension. Dr. Gertner started teaching at the University of Illinois in 2020 with the iCAN program because her is committed to broadening participation in computer science.
