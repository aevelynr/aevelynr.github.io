## Study Skills and Belonging
I am continuing to hand-correct the transcripts of the student interviews. The A.I. that was used to provide the initial base write-up does an excellent job of recognizing syllable components because even words that are specific to this course at the University of Illinois such as "examlet" instead of "exam" and the application "Piazza" are accurately captured. Where this software lacks clarity is following the cadence of spoken sentences with regards to punctuation. There are times in the students' interviews where a student will start to drop the pitch in their voice to indicate that they are near the end of a sentence, and the software will not end the sentence with a period. In addition, there are not reliable patterns for commas as well. 

I have a new appreciation for people in the linguistics and natural language processing space! I found a bit of time to read some articles, and this one I found to be the most [informative.](https://www.scaler.com/topics/speech-recognition-in-ai/)

From the user's speech, the audio is cleaned and processed, then the software does feature extraction, breaks the audio into phoentic components and parses through the speech, then outputs the text. The statistics and audio training behind these models is incredible. I am starting a summer course in databases today, so I hope I can gain more insight to see these programs from under the hood.

In addition, I have made progress in "coding" the interviews, said in another way, highlighting key words for later analysis. The student interviews that I analyzed seemed to be in contradiction with one another. When one student would say that the textbook is an integral part of their studying and used it for more than four hours a week, another student said they hardly used the textbook and preferred the lecture notes. One student would say that working in groups was not effective for them, and the other said they enjoyed working with their friends. In this dataset, we are beginning to see that there are multiple avenues for success and what "works" for one student is not guaranteed to "work" for another. I am interested to continue through these interviews to observe any more common threads (or opposites!).
