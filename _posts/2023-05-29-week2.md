## CS + X
This week was busy with considering student strengths and needs, designing lesson plan materials, and meeting with team members.
+ Daily Dojo 
  + We know from psychology and learning theory that students need to engage with and practice new skills frequently, so I created "bellringer" activities meant to be completed at the start of class. I researched exisiting curriculum and theory from computer science teachers and created my own interpretation based on what I know to be successful learning activities from my time as a teacher.
  + There are four mini lessons designed to have students continuously practice their Python and problem-solving skills and are intended to take between 10 -15 minutes at the start of each class: Dictionaries, NLP, Machine Learning, and Linguistics.  
  + Within each lesson, there are three differentiated activities that we as educators will recognize as beginner, intermediate, and advanced; however, when presented to the students, they will be asked to complete the one they are most interested and most comfortable performing. That way, the students can pick which of these, Illini/Blue/Orange, fits their needs and feel successful in their own way. They are encouraged and welcomed to complete more than one of the activities if they have extra time.
  + I chose to have the three activities because I know that differentiation is critical to engage and support students at all levels.
  + With beginner programmers in mind, the coding required is well-structured for them, and the topics are varied to cover NLP, linguistics, and machine learning, and introductory data structures such as dictionaries.
  + In addition, the top of each Google colab Daily Dojo workbook has an uplifting image or quote to encourage a sense of belonging in computer science.


+ English Grammar Review Game
  + The final project that my team member has designed works with parse trees and grammar rules to construct English sentences, so I created a review game to help the students remember their parts of speech and English grammar rules.   
  + This is a Kahoot, a quiz-based interactive game, to help students remember, relearn, and practice recognizing verbs, nouns, proper nouns, intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, and direct objects.
  + Within this Kahoot, there are informative slides about the concepts of parts of speech, and the trivia questions are applications of those concepts to avoid surface-level recognition and promote deeper learning.
  + This Kahoot will be made available to students who wish to review and practice on their own time outside of class.

+ Icebreaker
  +  I created a simple Python program that will output a randomly generated "get to know you" question.
  +  This program will be presented to students, and we will read through the code that includes the "random" package that the students will need to incorporate in their project. I am pre-teaching this vocabulary and package to students, so when they are ready to formally learn about the random package with regards to the project, they have seen the content before.
  +  From the Autism Hub website, they define preteaching as "a strategy that involves teaching students concepts or skills prior to a lesson on the subject". Even though this website discusses preteaching in terms of supporting students with Autism, preteaching has been shown to be helpful to all students. You can read more here: https://autismhub.education.qld.gov.au/resources/functional-behaviour-assessment-tool/help/pre-teaching#:~:text=Pre%2Dteaching%20is%20a%20strategy,to%20a%20lesson%20on%20geography
  +  As I was researching teen-friendly "get to know you" questions I came across some that seemed okay at first, but after I pondered, I decided to keep out. I saw that some questions can have classist undertones like "What has been your favorite vacation?", "How many times has your family been to Disney World?", "What kind of phone do you have?", or "What's your allowance?"
