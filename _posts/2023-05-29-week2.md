## CS + X
This week was busy with considering student strengths and needs, designing lesson plan materials, and meeting with team members.
+ Daily Dojo 
1. There are four mini lessons here designed to have students continuously practice their Python and problem-solving skills and are intended to take between 10 -15 minutes at the start of each class.  
The top of each notebook has an uplifting image to encourage a sense of belonging.
Within each lesson, there are three "levels" that we as educators will recognize as beginner, intermediate, and advanced, but the students will be none the wiser. That way, the students can pick which of these, Illini/Blue/Orange, fits their needs and feel successful in their own way. 
The coding required is minimal, but the topics cover NLP, linguistics, machine learning, and dictionaries.
English Grammar Review Game- This is a Kahoot, a quiz-based interactive game, to help students remember, relearn, and practice recognizing verbs, nouns, proper nouns, intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, direct objects, etc.
I envision this will take place on the second day as needed if we notice students struggling to recall these concepts. It is also a fun brain break.
Note: This must be led by someone with a Kahoot account
Icebreaker- Simple Python program that will output a randomly generated "get to know you" question.
For the first day meeting to break the ice, please feel free to add more "get to know you" questions in there.
As I was researching teen-friendly "get to know you" questions I came across some that seemed okay at first, but after I pondered, I decided to keep out. Please keep in mind the nature of some "get to know you" questions can have classist undertones like "What has been your favorite vacation?", "How many times has your family been to Disney World?", "What kind of phone do you have?", or "What's your allowance?"
Upward Bound: Silly Sentences
I have begun to organize the project template and ideas for extension. I would like to add options that follow the same Illini/Orange/Blue levels that students can self-select which one seems appropriate and interesting to them.
For Central High School, I am curious about wrapping this lesson into a larger theme like "Words of Wisdom" or haiku generator. Do we have thoughts on this?
Introduction to Python
The Upward Bound students and one student from Central High School may need help onboarding with Python skills. 
I have created a Colab notebook that will partner Sophia's presentation on beginning Python skills that looks at print statements, understanding traceback errors, if/elif/else, etc.
If we feel it would be helpful for the Central High School students who have taken AP Comp Sci, I am happy to make a "Java to Python" colab notebook that explores the differences between the two languages and what to expect. In my own experience, after working with Java for the last five months, writing in Python feels like writing pseudo code!!!
